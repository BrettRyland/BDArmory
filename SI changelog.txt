changes to moduleweapon/missile fire documented elsewhere

-tightened up Ai accuracy - can now be tuned
	
-added cluster ammo weighting to bool smartweaponselect

rockelauncher.cs removed
added pooledrocket.cs that contains rocket code
-rockets now have rocketdefs.cfg

-airdetonation/proximity detonation now per-ammotype, set in bulletdef via fuze setting
-changes to bulletdefs - added a fuze setting: None, Timed, Proximity, Flak
	-!!This will break all BDA mods!!
-tracer stats moved to bulletdefs following ammoswap implementation
-tracer width now dynamically determined based on caliber; can be overridded in weapon cfg (laser support, mainly)

-legacyblastpower/heat/radius depreciated, everything now uses tntmass
-subprojectileCount now works for rockets

ammo swap now supports rockets
	-adds Rocketinfo.Load() to BDArmorySetup.cs
	-rocket models now defined in rocketdef.cfg
ammo swap now has weborc hook for filering selected ammo types


todo: 
get rockets pooled. 
	attempting to set up the pool from moduleWeapon sorta worked, but broke model loading; 	rocketpod rockets loaded w/ wrong orientation/mesh wouldn't load, but emitter transform 	would
	-see about initializing the pool from within rocket.cs - see ExplosionFX's self-	initialization of the pool

Add choker rockers, laser-guided homing rockets, ???
add rocket kinetic damage/penetration

set ability to ammoswap inflight to a bool, default false so that most weapons have to be loaded in editor, but things like Abrams turret can select ammo inflight

fix rocketpods drawing from non-self ammo sources - ie H70 launcher getting ammo from a h70 turret

finish the electrolaser code - either have it be a temporary EMP effect, or have it be the beam has to add emp damage until it crosses a threshold, at which point ship gets EMP'd
