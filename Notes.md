### Branches
Current un-merged branches (`git branch --no-merged`) are:
- AoA — respecting maxAoA and max G-load AI settings
- bias-testing — testing bias due to spawn position or camera focus
- motherships — which AI/WM is in control when parasite fighters get detached and automatically adding them to competitions
- physx — consistency of results under time-warping

Outdated, probably to be deleted:
- spawn-strategy — partially implemented, then abandoned spawn strategy implementation by aubranium
- sph-inertia — Simple flight dynamics analysis draft impl by aubranium, better as a separate mod since it doesn't use anything BDA specific.
